= Selecting the compression method =

To select the best candidate method for compressing we need to know
how fast a given compression method is.

This is done by collecting statistics during run.

For each block compressed the method, block size, compress ratio, and
cpu-time per byte to compress is recorded.

We assume that the next block of data compresses just as well as the
previous block.

Dynzip will know how fast it is sending data and thus know the current
target bandwidth to hit.

If dynzip is sending slower than needed, decrease block size and look
for methods that take less cpu time.

If dynzip is sending faster than needed, increase block size and look
for methods that have higher compress ratios.

The statistics will be saved with a filename depending on the
hostname, and will be aggregated after each run.

The selected methods should be based on probability (a particle filter
might be good), so that if method A is normally both slower and
compresses less than method B then method B should be selected more
often than method A, but method A should be selected now and then.
